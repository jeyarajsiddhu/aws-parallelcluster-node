Hi,

I would like to create a cluster using parallel cluster on AWS. Please find the steps which i have followed below,

Steps:

# sudo yum install -y https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm

# yum install epel-release

# sudo yum install -y python36u python36u-libs python36u-devel python36u-pip

# yum install python-pip

# sudo pip3.6 install aws-parallelcluster

# sudo pip install awscli

# aws configure
# pcluster configure

# nano /root/.parallelcluster/config


[aws]
aws_region_name = ap-south-1
aws_access_key_id = AKIAJO6NAY3QUQNPKCTA
aws_secret_access_key = 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

[cluster CAWS]
key_name = CalligoAWS
vpc_settings = public
initial_queue_size = 2
max_queue_size = 2
master_instance_type = c5.large
compute_instance_type = c5.18xlarge
maintain_initial_size = true
cluster_type = spot
scheduler = slurm
placement_group = DYNAMIC
base_os = centos7
enable_efa = compute

[vpc public]
vpc_id = vpc-5fd9ad36
master_subnet_id = subnet-6243e82f

[ebs myebs]
shared_dir = shared
volume_type = st1
volume_size = 10

[global]
cluster_template = CAWS
update_check = true
sanity_check = true

[aliases]
ssh = ssh {CFN_USER}@{MASTER_IP} {ARGS}


## With the above configuration file i tried creating the cluster via the below command,

# pcluster create mycluster

# Later i see 1 cluster (Master) getting created and get terminated in no time for no reason and the compute is not even getting created ..

Request your help here, not sure what is going wrong with this. 

Please suggest !!
